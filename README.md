Hello, welcome on my github page. 
Here you can find some examples of my work which I was doing during my time as a resarch assistant at the Masaryk University. 
You can find here 3 of my projects (MindGameAndTullock, TrustAndStrategic and probably my most difficult one so far ExperimentJaro23)
I also added one file where you can find my skills in R. I was doing some data cleaning for my diploma thesis with a raw data from Eurostat and ČSÚ. 
If you want to see more or you have any questions feel free to contant me here -> cermak.kuba8@seznam.cz or www.linkedin.com/in/jakub-čermák-715769283

Wish you a nice day!
