<div class="text">In the experiment, you will be matched with another participant, whom we will call your opponent. </div>
<br>
<div class="text">Your opponent was asked to think of any <b>two numbers</b> from 1 to 6 and remember them. He/she was then asked to roll a die and report whether the number he/she rolled was one of the two numbers he/she thought of. There are two possible outcomes of the game:</div>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Your opponent reports that the rolled number <b>is</b> one of the two numbers he/she thought of. Then your opponent will receive a payment of £2, and you will be paid £0.</li>
    <li>Your opponent reports that the rolled number <b>is not</b> one of the two numbers he/she thought of. Then your opponent will receive a payment of £0, and you will be paid £2.</li>
