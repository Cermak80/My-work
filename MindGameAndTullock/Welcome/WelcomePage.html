<div class="text">Welcome to our experiment! It is important that you read the following instructions carefully and understand them. You can earn money in this experiment.

If you fail to complete any screen within the time limit, your participation will be discontinued and you will not receive any payment. If the participant you are matched with fails to complete his/her screen within the time limit, your participation will be discontinued and you will receive a payment of £2.</div>
